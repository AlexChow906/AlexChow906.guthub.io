# How to Prevent Coronavirus
1. Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions
2. Follow advice provided by your local health authority

## To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
* Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
* Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
* Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
* Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
* Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
* Stay home if you feel unwell.
* If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
* Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.

## Masks
Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the advice provided by your local health authority.

There are different levels of masks that provide you with different types of protection.

* Level 1: Low barrier protection for general use for low-risk, nonsurgical procedures and exams that do not involve aerosols, sprays and fluids. An ear loop mask is a level 1 mask. ASTM level 1 masks are the general standard for both surgical and procedural use.

* Level 2: Moderate barrier protection for low-to-moderate levels of aerosols, sprays and fluids.

* Level 3: Maximum barrier protection for any situation that has the potential for exposure to heavy levels of aerosols, sprays and fluids. Cardinal Health recommends this level as a best practice for supporting OR safety initiatives.
